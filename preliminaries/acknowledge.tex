There are many people that have earned my gratitude for their contribution to my time in graduate school.
While I will struggle to name them all, I do wish to specifically thank those people who have helped
teach me their knowledge of physics along the way:
Tim Nelson, Cam Bravo, Matt Graham, PF Butti, Omar Moreno, Philip Schuster, Natalia Toro, Stefania Gori,
Lene Kristian Bryngemark, Einar El\'{e}n, Erik Wallin, Christian Herwig, Nhan Tran, Cristina Mantilla Suarez,
Lauren Tompkins, Valentina Dutta, Ruth P{\"o}ttgen, and Alic Spellman.

Of particular note is my advisor Jeremy Mans.
Professor Mans has been wonderfully flexible as I have changed course while navigating the uncertain waters of graduate school.
Thank you.

Finally, there are many friends who I have met while in graduate school or with whom I have gotten closer.
Your support outside of physics has been necessary for me over the years and I am in your debt.
