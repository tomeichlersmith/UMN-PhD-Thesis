Both \ac{ldmx} and \ac{hps} are important and required experiments in our search
for the particle nature of \ac{dm}.


\section{Reflection}
This dissertation work has shown me the full breadth of a particle physics experiment.
From initial design and simulation, to extensions and validations of said simulation,
to intricate considerations of potential systematic errors in the experiment,
to optimization of selections using various figures of merit,
to intentional analysis blinding to avoid statistical bias when developing an analysis,
to final unblinding after proposals and evaluations,
to post-mortem analysis of the leftover bits of data.

All of these small steps brought with them lessons.
Lessons for which I am grateful.
