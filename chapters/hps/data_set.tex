\section{Simulated Data} \label{sec:hps:sim}
Proper study of the iDM signal model necessitates simulating how the HPS detector
would respond if interactions originating from such a process were to occur.

Signal event production flow
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\sc MadGraph/MadEvent} generation of prompt iDM events
	\item Displacement of decay products in a \emph{uniform} distribution
	\item Simulation of detector response with \textsc{Geant}4 and \texttt{slic}
	\item Emulation of readout
	\item Normal reconstruction pipeline that data retrieved from the detector
	      also goes through
\end{enumerate}

Moreover, simulated samples of standard data allows us to study how the detector
responds in the absence of such a signal process. These samples are produced in
a similar way as iDM signal - just with a different original generation step
initializing the event (and inserting the physical displacement distribution
instead of a uniform one).
