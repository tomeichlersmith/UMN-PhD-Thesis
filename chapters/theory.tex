Many physicists throughout history have been puzzled by new phenomena, but the
confusion surrounding dark matter -- estimated to be roughly 85\% of the total
matter in the universe -- is surely one of the biggest puzzles. While many
astronomical observations at various scales have confirmed the existence of
dark matter, we have yet seen any observations of its particle interacting
with our detectors. This has ruled out many models for dark matter's particle
nature, but there are still many more available which can both explain the
current observations of dark matter gravitational and cosmological effects
while skirt the limitations defined by the \emph{lack} of observation in
particle experiments.

\section{Dark Matter?}
As mentioned earlier, we physicists are a lazy bunch.
Instead of referring to these phenomena (\cref{sec:dm:evidence}) with a more accurate description,
we invented a new term for our community to refer to it.
``Matter'' originates from comparison to the particles that make ourselves up and with which
we are familiar -- both interact gravitationally, attracting other groups of ``matter'' into
complex cosmological systems.
The adjective ``dark'' refers to the literal fact that we cannot see it with our telescopes.
Other matter out in the universe can be seen via the light\footnote{
    Technically, I should say ``electromagnetic radiation'' since some observations use
    non-visible wavelengths (e.g. radio waves) to make observations of the cosmos, but that
    technicality gets in the way of motivating the ``dark'' adjective.
} that it gives off (or reflects),
so the fact that this matter \emph{is not} visible in this way motivates the adjective.

That is it. \gls{dm-full} is merely a shorthand for this unknown aspect of the universe.

\section{Evidence for Dark Matter}
\label{sec:dm:evidence}

The first evidence physicists had for an unseen material floating throughout the universe
was the observation of galactic rotation curves \cite{rubin-rotationcurve-1980,rotationcurve-2000}.
These observations measure the speed of different stars within a galaxy and compare this speed to
the distance of that star from the center of the galaxy. We can calculate this relationship
using \gls{gr} \cite{rotationcurve-predictions-2007} and the
observations differ drastically from this calculation. The stars within galaxies we've observed move
much faster than \gls{gr} would predict (\cref{fig:rotation-curve}) leaving us with two explanations: either \gls{gr} is not the correct theory
to use in this situation or there is more un-seen mass floating within the galaxy allowing these stars
to move faster without leaving the galactic orbit.

Other indirect measurements give us additional ways to access information about this odd phenomena.
Within the framework of \gls{gr}, since energy and mass actually warp the fabric of spacetime,
we expect to see light itself follow a bent path around massive objects - a phenomenum that is called
\gls{grav-lens} and is observed and well modeled by \gls{gr}'s predictions \cite{gravlensing-2004}.
The accuracy of \gls{gr} within this context - a mass and distance scale similar to the rotation curve oddities also observed -
put more requirements on any modified theory of gravity that could both explain the rotation curves and gravitational lensing.
Additionally, measurements on some of the largest scales and from the early universe
display signs of a certain mass density attributed to non-baryonic matter.

The \gls{cmb} and \gls{bao} provide a method for deducing densities of various classes of matter
in the early universe. Gravity attracts while pressure from the squeezing of the plasma repules
which produces oscillations in the density of matter in space and time. These \gls{bao} are
imprinted on our snapshot of this early-universe plasma, the \gls{cmb}, which we can measure with
a high degree of accuracy and fit to various models of what existed at this time of the universe.
The best fit of these models corresponds to only $\sim 5\%$ of the mass density being normal matter
like we see today while the rest is composed of material that only significantly
interacts gravitationally \cite{planck-cmb-2015}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Astronomy observations show lots of measurements
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Type1a Supernovae \cite{type1a-supernova-2010}
              \item Big Bang Nucleosynthesis \cite{nucleosynthesis-1998}
              \item Probably not mini black holes \cite{constraints-primordial-black-holes-2021}
          \end{itemize}
    \item Can conclude pretty comfortably that DM exists
\end{itemize}

        (and the solid line fitted to them) are what are actually seen in galaxies today.

\section{Particle Nature of Dark Matter}
The theoretical possibilities explaining dark matter are broad \cite{darksectors-2016}
event when excluding ourselves to the assumption that the dark matter phenomenum is explained
by the existence of a dark matter particle since the start of the start of the universe alongside
our normal matter particles. Here, I will refer to this particular dark matter
as \gls{dm} which, in general, needs to satisfy the following requirements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dark} There has been no detection of these particles via the light observed with our telescopes;
          therefore, the dark matter has to not interact via the electromagnetic force.
    \item \textbf{Long Living} Measurements of \gls{dm}'s mass density and presence agree across time
          (from as early as the \gls{cmb} era), so \gls{dm} needs to have a long lifetime.
    \item \textbf{Observable Here} Measurements of \gls{dm} agree across different points in space,
          so it must be observable here on earth in some terresterial experiment.
    \item \textbf{Thermal Relic} Both \gls{dm} and standard matter have similar
          cosmological densities, so we expect some interaction (even a weak one) should connect their
          origins to the early universe allowing both to exist from the Big Bang.
    \item \textbf{Universal Density} Since we can indirectly measure a \gls{dm} mass density on
          cosmological scales, we impose the requirement that any \gls{dm} model needs to allow for
          this density.
\end{itemize}
Even with these assumptions and the requirements they imply, there still exist a plethora of
theoretical models that can satisfy all of them.

The upside is that a thermal-relic assumption closely connects the mass of individual \gls{dm} particles
to the interaction strength it has with standard matter. In this assumption, the \gls{dm} evolves along
with the universe allowing its number density to follow the density of standard matter until it becomes
too sparse to annihilate with itself and is thus ``frozen'' at a specific number density. Since this ``frozen''
density changes depending on how easy it is for the the \gls{dm} to interact with standard matter,
the ``frozen'' number density goes down as the interaction strength increases (\cref{fig:number-density}).
The additional requirement of the observed astronomical \emph{mass} density connects
the mass of individual \gls{dm} particles to their interaction strength with standard matter.
\begin{equation*}
    m_\chi \leftrightarrow \text{observed mass density}
    \leftrightarrow \frac{dN}{dV} \leftrightarrow
    \text{thermal relic hypothesis} \leftrightarrow
    \langle\sigma v\rangle
\end{equation*}
This connection allows us to define strict ``thermal relic targets'' which can help be measuring
sticks for how well our experiments search for \gls{dm} (these targets will appear in plots later).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/theory/number-density-at-freeze-out.png}
    \caption{
        From \cite{thermal-freezeout-diagram-1996}, the co-moving cosmological number density of \gls{dm} as a function of the universe
        temperature. As the universe cools, the number density decreases until the \gls{dm}
        becomes too sparse to interact with other \gls{dm} particles, ``freezing'' to a specific
        number density until today.
    }
    \label{fig:number-density}
\end{figure}

In addition to the connection between interaction strength and particle mass implied by the thermal
relic hypothesis, it also puts some loose bounds on mass of individual particles (\cref{fig:dm-mass-scale}).
If the mass is too low (approximately below the mass of the electron $m_e$), then it is not feasible within our early-universe models to produce enough
\gls{dm} to match the observed \gls{dm} density currently frozen in. Similarly, if the mass is too
high ($\gtrapprox 100~\text{TeV}$), the \gls{dm} will be too strongly coupled to the standard matter and would be over-produced.
\todo{Not sure about correctness of this.}

The mass scale of thermal relic \gls{dm} is further divided by the mass of the proton ($m_p$).
Above this threshold, the \gls{dm} could be interacting with standard matter through the standard
Weak Force (capital ``W'')\footnote{
    The force already known to exist in nature which is responsible for phenomena
    like muon decay and nuclear fission.
}; thus, they are named Weakly Interacting Massing Particles (WIMPs). This phase space was
first searched due to its theoretical simplicitity: no new forces, just an extra particle (or two)
creating the clouds of \gls{dm} we see today. Unfortunately, these searches have not found evidence
of a WIMP-like signature\cite{supercdms-2018,damic-2020,xenon1t-2018} and the phase space has become tighter
and more exluded after many years of searching. Below this threshold, the \gls{dm} requires a new
force which also does not interact strongly with standard matter. In comparison to the heavier WIMPs,
this category of \gls{dm} is called ``Light'' \gls{dm}.

    \centering
    \input{figures/theory/mass-scale}
    \caption{Mass scale of Thermal Relic \gls{dm}.
        The regions in red are excluded by applying the thermal relic assumption
        to our observations of the universe's early evolution.}
    \label{fig:dm-mass-scale}
\end{figure}

In general, the definition of a new force of nature is not well constrained; however, we can
define a ``baseline'' model that can represent more concrete theories in the context of our experiments.
For this situation, we postulate the existence of a massive gauge boson that represents an additional
$U_D(1)$ symmetry of nature. Since this additional symmetry has the same structure as the electromagnetic
interaction whose gauge boson is the standard photon, we generally refer to this postulated massive boson
as a \gls{dark-photon}. Without any additional assumptions, this new \gls{dark-photon} does not interact
with any standard matter, so we also assume that some previously-unknown massive fields are able to interact with
both. These other fields need to be sufficiently massive (or sufficiently weakly coupled) so that they only allow
the standard and dark photons to weakly mix. \cref{fig:photon-mixing} diagrams how the standard and dark
photons mix which can then be effectively represented by a new vertex in our model.

where the mixing strength $\epsilon$ encapsulates the effect of a massive field $\Phi$ at the energies
of our experiments (presumably low enough to avoid creation of a $\Phi$ directly).

This new vertex within our model for the universe enables a new process to occur: so-called
``Dark Bremsstrahlung'' (dark brem) where a charged particle exchanges a standard photon with
a nucleus and then emits a dark photon and recoils.

\end{figure}

But what happens to the dark photon after it interacts with standard matter via this vertex?
It cannot be the long-lived \gls{dm} we view in the universe today because this vertex allows for
it to decay \emph{back} into standard matter pretty easily. This is where we expand on the idea of
a ``dark sector''. In this description of \gls{dm}, we already have a dark photon representing some
force and a very heavy field that can interact with it. Suppose this ``dark sector'' also has other
particles (like the standard sector) -- one (or more) of which could be long-lived and represent
the \gls{dm} we observe in the universe today (so-called ``\gls{dm} candidates''). We can further
partition this category of models depending on what happens to the \gls{dark-photon} after we produce
it within an experiment.
