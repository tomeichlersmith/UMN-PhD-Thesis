The long and winding road of a dissertation is not always neatly packaged into a template - this
can easily be seen in my own experience. While focusing much of my time on the technical aspects of
data processing software for a proposed (yet to be built) experiment, I found myself near the end
of my journey without \emph{real} data to analyze from which I can make \emph{real} conclusions
about the physical world. This motivated me to participate in another experiment -- extremely
similar to the original one -- sharing theoretical motivations, technological designs, and even
people. This experience of participating in two similar experiments has provided an abundant field
of learning opportunities (as well as roadblocks) for me and my journey as a new physicist.

Physics is a lazy science. I would go even further and state that this reductionist perspective is
a main attraction for many physicists. We\footnote{Here I use the ``royal we'' as representing my
  point of view of the culture within the field. It should in no way be construed as scientific or
  exact statements and does not represent every physicist's point of view.} want to avoid memorizing
as much as possible; therefore, motivating the idea of condensing sets of observations into
``laws'' that can be represented in an even more compact mathematical form. We make up these
``laws'' and the vocabulary surrounding them not to decieve but merely to make communication about
our observations and the experiments that make these observations easier. We sometimes debate the
origins of these laws and their true philosophical meaning, but often, on a day-to-day basis, the
background of them is unimportant. The interesting work comes from \emph{testing} them, breaking
them, and remaking them. For our purposes here, this is what a ``theory'' is: a package of laws and
their mathematical forms with which we can make predictions of the observations of our experiments.

While I speak in the context of all physics, in reality, I am residing within a small corner.
Primarily concerned with individual particles and how they interact with one another, my field can
be described as investigating the foundations of the universe. Our experiments require giving these
particles comparatively large amounts of energy, contextualizing the name \ac{hep}. Giving
such small particles such large amounts of energy requires extrodinarily large and complex
apparatuses. \ac{hep} is filled with experiments many stories tall, collaborations consisting of
hundreds of institutions and thousands of people, and observations lasting years if not decades.
This grand scale is helpful to keep in mind when I speak of the experiments in this thesis -- only
a few institutions (less than 10 in each) and only dozens of collaborators. Contrary to many other
sciences and experimental methods, these experiments still last longer than a typical doctoral
student career. While I report on these experiments, I will not detail their full operation,
design, or capabilities. I will focus on the work that I was able to contribute; hopefully
providing a building block for these experiments and \ac{hep} to grow in the future, and give only
the necessary context for parts with which I am less familiar.

Before partitioning this thesis according to the two experiments in which I participated,
\cref{sec:sm} summarizes our current laws and its representative theory that best predict our set
of observations within \ac{hep}, \cref{chapter:dm} will explore the theoretical ground on which
both of the experiments rest which will also provide necessary vocabulary for discussing these two
experiments. \cref{part:ldmx} presents the work of my initial years as a graduate student
developing data processing and realistic simulation software for a proposed experiment. This part
includes a description of this proposed experiment in \cref{chapter:ldmx:experiment}, the
simulation infrastructure for it in \cref{chapter:ldmx:simulation}, and an analysis of this
simulated data showcasing this experiment's performance in its early stages
\cref{chapter:ldmx:analysis}. \cref{part:hps} describes the work of my last years showing the
difficulties of working with data taken in the real world (with all the complexities that implies).
Similar to \cref{part:ldmx}, this part describes the experimental setup in
\cref{chapter:hps:experiment}, \todo{insert rest of chapters}. We then conclude with
\cref{chapter:conclusion} which returns back to this high-level-view from which we can discuss what
we have learned about physics via these two experiments.

\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{sec:sm}

What makes up all the stuff around us? This question has been posed, debated, discussed, and
studied since the ancient times. Our best current understanding is that stuff is made of particles
that interact with one another. While ``particle'' is difficult to strictly define qualitatively,
we have a model for them and their interactions which we creatively named the ``Standard Model''
(SM). \cref{fig:sm} displays the known elementary particles, some of their basic properties, and
how they interact with one another. Not all of the particles represented within this diagram are of
critical importance to this work, but some deserve further description.

  \label{fig:sm}
\end{figure}

The two lowest mass quarks -- the up and the down -- are the fundamental constituents of protons
and neutrons which make up the nuclei of atoms which make up all the day-to-day stuff we interact
with. These stay bound together within these nuclei via the strong nuclear force (mediated and
represented in \cref{fig:sm} by the gluon). These quarks and the top row of leptons also have an
electric charge enabling them to interact via with electromagnetic force (or equivalently exchange
photons). The electromagnetic force, represented and mediated by the photon, is the force
responsible for light and magnetism. The lowest mass charged lepton (electron) is also very
abundant -- most commonly residing in orbits around nuclei helping form atoms. Both experiments in
this thesis utilize beams of electrons that have been accelerated to high energies and then
impinge upon a material of high density to initiate interactions for further study.

The mathematical expressions to calculate how these particles interact are complicated. As
mentioned earlier, physicists are lazy and so we have developed a method to represent the specifics
of these interactions without needing to write down any of the long mathematical formulae. These
representations are called ``Feynman diagrams'' after the 20th century physicist Richard Feynman.
Feynman diagrams allow us to represent interactions by defining a set of ``vertices'' that are
allowed by our theory and then constructing processes from these vertices that include the in- and
out- going particles that we wish to study. The further calculation of these diagrams is a defined
process that has been written into various computer programs (I say this to emphasize that these
diagrams directly represent the mathematics that can be used to calculate them).
\cref{fig:brem-feynman} shows an example Feynman diagram representing the bremsstrahlung process
where a charged lepton (\(\ell^-\)) interacts with a nucleus (\(Z\)) via a photon (\(\gamma\)) and
then emits another photon before recoiling. We can see three verticies in this diagram: two
``fundamental'' vertices where the lepton and photon lines connect and one ``effective'' vertex
where the photon connects with the nucleus. The fundamental vertices are actually strictly defined
within the Standard Model, but the effective vertex represents a helpful approximation that is
accurate at the energy scales we are studying.\footnote{ The distinction between fundamental and
  effective vertices is not a well defined one. I find it helpful here, but it is not necessarily
  made elsewhere in physics literature. }

      \vertex [below right=of emit] (decay) {\(\gamma\)};

      };

  \end{tikzpicture}

  \label{fig:brem-feynman}
\end{figure}

Due to the complexity of the nucleus itself, the calculation of \cref{fig:brem-feynman} into
any observables is difficult to do without any approximations. However, one of the initial parametrizations of
bremsstrahlung offers a good glimpse of how it behaves \cite{bethe-heitler-1934}.
When doing experiments, we often count the number of particles produced with certain criteria.
These ``rates'' can then be translated into estimates of process cross sections (how likely a process
is to occur producing particles with the observed properties) with knowledge of
how the experiment was conducted. These cross sections are also calculatable from diagrams like
\cref{fig:brem-feynman} and the initial parameterization can be summarized as
\[
  \frac{d\sigma}{d E_\gamma} \propto \frac{1}{E_\gamma}
\]
This shows the dominant shape of the cross section \todo[figure]{brem photon figure of some kind}
-- it grows as the energy of the produced photon
(\(E_\gamma\)) gets smaller. The full expression prevents the cross section from diverging as the
photon energy approaches zero; nevertheless, the general inverse relationship between the rate and
the energy of the produced photon holds in both the \ac{sm} calculations and observations from
experiments.\todo[citation]{need a citation for observation of bremsstrahlung photon energies?}

This inverse relationship is somewhat special and is mostly due to the fact that photons
do not have any mass; however, this special relationship opens a door towards potential
discovery. The vast majority of electrons interacting with a material will do so softly,
only emitting low energy photons, which distinctly separates these electrons from ones
that undergo rarer processes (or perhaps so-far undiscovered processes). Both experiments
described in this work make heavy use of this fact.\todo[more]{make sure to reference back
to softness of sm brem in experiment sections.}

For the rest of this thesis, I intend to stay within this diagrammatic realm -- representing the theoretical
calculations being tested with these diagrams and limiting the scope of mathematical formulae
presented. Occasionally, the weight of these vertices which can be interpreted as the strength
of the interaction is presented along with the vertices in order to give a sense of scale
and connect these diagrams to the formulae that are included here.

\subsection{Mixing and Displacement in the Standard Model}
One of the key aspects of the projects included here are the concepts of particle mixing
and particle decays displaced in position compared to where the particle was produced.
Neither of these concepts are purely theoretical both can be observed with known
particles and known interactions. The Kaon system can provide examples of both of these
phenomena.

\begin{todoenv}
The Kaon system in the SM is rich with interesting physics and provides examples of specific
physical phenomena that we can apply to our search for new physics.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\overline{K}_0 \leftrightarrow K_0\) via the box diagram observable via oscillation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kaon-box-diagram-with-bar.svg is a good diagram, just need to figure out how to cite
  \end{itemize}
  \item \(K_S\) 2-body decay is displaced by $O(3~\text{cm})$
\end{itemize}

Look into a kinetic mixing example from SM. Point out how particles can ``mix'' with one another
in this quantum realm. Strong KM of photon (hadronix FF), maybe photon and Z mixing?
