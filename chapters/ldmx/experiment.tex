\chapter{LDMX}
\label{chapter:ldmx:experiment}

\gls{ldmx} is a proposed fixed-target experiment aiming to definitively explore
the light dark matter phase space. Even as a proposed experiment, it has a detailed
plan for construction, a beam already in construction, and well established connections
with current technologies used within \gls{hep}. While \gls{ldmx} is not yet built,
it has a well formulated simulation infrastructure that can realistically model
how the detector design responds to various types of interactions happening within it.

\section{The Beam Line}
LCLSII and LESA

\section{Detector Design}
Overall LDMX and its subsystems.

\section{ECal}
More detail about ECal since it relates to the ME search later.
