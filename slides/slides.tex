\note[itemize]{
\item Simplifying assumption: Dark Matter has always been here (like standard matter)
  and was in thermal equilibrium with standard matter in the early universe
\item (Observations of the CMB also imply this so its a decently motivated assumption.)
\item Limits the scale of mass of DM particles by connecting the mass to the interaction
  strength
\item Above $m_p\sim\qty{1}{\GeV}$, the interaction could be provided by the standard Weak
  force (so-called WIMPs), many experiments searching in this region
\item Below $m_p$, the interaction needs to be even weaker than the standard Weak force
\item Particles are lighter than WIMPs so referred to as Light DM

\note[itemize]{
\item The thermal relic assumption combined with curiosity for the lower masses
  requires the introduction of a new field which is presumably much heavier
  (i.e. harder to produce and observe) than our current energies.
\item This required connection does provide an effictive mixing of the standard
  and dark photons (like how kaons can mix) at our energy scales
\item Allowing for this mixing then gives a new process that can produce
  dark particles in our experiments -- dark bremsstrahlung
\item Both HPS and LDMX search for dark brem; however, they have different
  tactics to look for it
}

\ssection{LDMX}

\note[itemize]{
\item First, let's talk about the experiment I started with
\item The Light Dark Matter eXperiment is a \textbf{Missing Momentum} search for
  the dark bremsstralung production of dark particles with an electron beam
\item i.e. We assume that the dark photon that is produced ``stays in'' the dark sector
  and the momentum it had is not observable by our detector

  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item LDMX, as mentioned, is a MM search and, to do MM, we need to be able to faithfully
  ID very rare SM processes
\item Here is a diagram of prominent SM processes ordered by their relative rate
\item Blue -- high rate processes that we can ID with fast total energy calculation 
  (given we know how many electrons are coming in)
\item Pink -- rarer processes that are more complicated requiring more granular
  information about what happens to the products of the electron's interactions
  (hadronic calorimeter, silicon recoil tracker)
\item Red -- very rare processes that we will not be able to remove
  (but could constrain using measurements of these processes by other experiments)

\note[itemize]{
\item These processes motivate a staged design
  \begin{itemize}
    \item a tracker (tagger for incoming and recoil for outgoing)
    \item ECal for electrons/positrons and photons
    \item HCal for hadrons (e.g. protons/neutrons) and muons
    \item a TrigScint to quickly count electrons and help ECal make trigger decision in time.
  \end{itemize}
\item Hosted at SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, recieving beam from LCLS-II 
\item Beam facility upgrading from \qty{4}{\GeV} to \qty{8}{\GeV}, LDMX may see
  some \qty{4}{\GeV} beam depending on how schedules line up but a majority
  of data will be taken with \qty{8}{\GeV}
\item \textbf{Thin target to help momentum resolution.} -- most electrons pass through
  only minimally interacting
\item Can we still use this data we would collect anyways?

\note[itemize]{
\item Yes we can!
\item If the dark brem process exists and would happen in the thin target,
  it would also happen within other parts of our detector -- namely the ECal
  which has a lot of material and would recieve similar numbers of electrons as
  the target
\item Use the Ecal as another Target for our dark brem search
\item Shift focus to \textbf{Missing Energy} search
\item Use upstream detectors to confirm near-beam-energy electron entering ECal \\
  (orthogonality condition, MM search requires significant loss within thin target)
\item ECal has more material $\to$ more ``chances'' for dark brem to happen \\
  (about $\sim 3$ times more when accounting for acceptance and trigger efficiency)

\note[itemize]{
\item HPS takes a different approach towards searching for dark brem
\item Instead of looking for extra events with missing energy/momentum,
  we look for extra events with a specific reconstructed quantities
}

\subsection{Experiment}
\begin{frame}{Experiment}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/hps/experiment/hps-diagram.pdf}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item Searching for highly-displaced electron-positron pairs with specific mass
\item High rate of incident electrons to overcome mixing twice
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[$\to$] most pass through thin target without much interaction\
    \item[$\to$] hole in detector to let this high rate of (uninteresting) electrons pass without
  irradiating detector
  \end{itemize}
\item ECal to quickly observe multiple candidate particles and make data collection decision
\item Silicon Vertex Tracker to reconstruct tracks and vertices
\item Benefits
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Physical quantities come with any DM observation
    \item More specific event topology required for standard process to be considered background
  \end{itemize}
\item Downsides
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Need to ``go through'' mixing twice and thus need much higher data volume
    \item Dark sector needs to be ``more defined'' so we can predict
      how it decays back into standard particles
  \end{itemize}
\item Many possible dark sectors yield the correct thermal relic abundance
\item Choose one to focus on for further analysis

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Dark sector contains ``dark quarks'' -- $\pi_D$ and $V_D$ are mesons like
          standard $\pi$ and $\rho$
        \good Decouples production rate from decay rate
        \bad  Missing energy lost to $\pi_D$ during decay chain
      \end{itemize}

        m_\mathrm{reco} = m_{V_D} \qquad
        z_\mathrm{reco} \sim e^{-z/(c\tau_{V_D})}
      $$
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item HPS's 2016 dataset is relatively small meaning a simpler dark sector that has
  the dark photon decaying back to electron-positron pair itself was not reachable
\item SIMPs decouple the production and decay rate allowing real sensitivity for HPS
  within this smaller dataset
