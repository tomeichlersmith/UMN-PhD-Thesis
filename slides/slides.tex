\note[itemize]{
\item Welcome, I'll be talking about my disseration research focused
  on two fixed target experiments (HPS and LDMX) looking for the production
  of dark matter.
\item Please offer feedback -- first attempt to unify the two experiments into one talk.
\item Trying to focus on making talk cohesive

\item Laws are summaries of observations and models

\item The SM is the most quantitatively accurate physics model ever known to human kind.
\item It is a package of particles and their interactions (also represented by particles)
  from which we can -- with a specific mathematical framework -- make predictions about
  our observations.
\item \textbf{BUT} it fails to account for all observed phenomena (e.g. \emph{gravity})

\note[itemize]{
\item Simplifying assumption: Dark Matter has always been here (like standard matter)
  and was in thermal equilibrium with standard matter in the early universe
\item (Observations of the CMB also imply this so its a decently motivated assumption.)
\item Limits the scale of mass of DM particles by connecting the mass to the interaction
  strength
\item Above $m_p\sim\qty{1}{\GeV}$, the interaction could be provided by the standard Weak
  force (so-called WIMPs), many experiments searching in this region
\item Below $m_p$, the interaction needs to be even weaker than the standard Weak force
\item Particles are lighter than WIMPs so referred to as Light DM

      \boldcol{UMNSunny}{Both HPS and LDMX search for this production mechanism}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item The thermal relic assumption combined with curiosity for the lower masses
  requires the introduction of a new field which is presumably much heavier
  (i.e. harder to produce and observe) than our current energies.
\item This required connection does provide an effictive mixing of the standard
  and dark photons (like how kaons can mix) at our energy scales
\item Allowing for this mixing then gives a new process that can produce
  dark particles in our experiments -- dark bremsstrahlung
\item Both HPS and LDMX search for dark brem; however, they have different
  tactics to look for it
}

\ssection{LDMX}

\note[itemize]{
\item First, let's talk about the experiment I started with
\item The Light Dark Matter eXperiment is a \textbf{Missing Momentum} search for
  the dark bremsstralung production of dark particles with an electron beam
\item i.e. We assume that the dark photon that is produced ``stays in'' the dark sector
  and the momentum it had is not observable by our detector

  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item LDMX, as mentioned, is a MM search and, to do MM, we need to be able to faithfully
  ID very rare SM processes
\item Here is a diagram of prominent SM processes ordered by their relative rate
\item Blue -- high rate processes that we can ID with fast total energy calculation 
  (given we know how many electrons are coming in)
\item Pink -- rarer processes that are more complicated requiring more granular
  information about what happens to the products of the electron's interactions
  (hadronic calorimeter, silicon recoil tracker)
\item Red -- very rare processes that we will not be able to remove
  (but could constrain using measurements of these processes by other experiments)
}

\begin{frame}{Experiment}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/ldmx/experiment/detector.png}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item These processes motivate a staged design consisting of a tracker (tagger
  for incoming and recoil for outgoing), ECal for electrons/positrons and photons,
  HCal for hadrons (e.g. protons/neutrons) and muson, and a TrigScint to
  quickly count electrons and help ECal make trigger decision in time.
\item Hosted at SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, recieving beam from LCLS-II 
\item Beam facility upgrading from \qty{4}{\GeV} to \qty{8}{\GeV}, LDMX may see
  some \qty{4}{\GeV} beam depending on how schedules line up but a majority
  of data will be taken with \qty{8}{\GeV}
